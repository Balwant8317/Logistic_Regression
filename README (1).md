Title:Loan Return Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This is a machine learning project that utilizes logistic regression to predict whether a customer will return a loan or not. Logistic regression is a common classification algorithm that is well-suited for binary and multi-class classification problems.


Predicting whether a customer will return a loan is a crucial task for financial institutions to assess credit risk. Logistic regression is a statistical method used to analyze a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this project, we have implemented a logistic regression model to predict loan return status based on various customer attributes.
